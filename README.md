# Design-Pattern
Exploring design patterns concept (Creational, Structural, Behavioural)

Creational:

Factory Method (Provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of object that will be created.

Abstract Factory Method (Lets you produce families of related objects withot specifying their concrete classes)

Builders (Lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representation of an object using the same construction code

Prototype (Lets you copy exsisting objects without making your code dependent on their classes)

Singleton (Lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance)
