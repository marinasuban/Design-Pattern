# Design-Pattern
Exploring design patterns concept (Creational, Structural, Behavioural)

Creational:


Factory Method (Provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of object that will be created.

Abstract Factory Method (Lets you produce families of related objects withot specifying their concrete classes)

Builders (Lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representation of an object using the same construction code

Prototype (Lets you copy exsisting objects without making your code dependent on their classes)

Singleton (Lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance)



Structural:


Adapter (Allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate)

Bridge (Lets you split a large class or a set of closely related classes into seperate hierarchies - abstraction and implementation - which can be developed independently of each other)

Composite (Lets you compose objects into tree structures then work with these structures as if they were individual objects)

Decorator (Lets you attach new behaviour to objects by placing these objects inside a special wrapper object that contains the new behaviour)

Facade (Provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework or any other complex set of classes)

Flyweight (Lets you fit more objects into the avaliable amount of RAM by sharing common parts of state between multiple objects instead of keeping all of the data in each object)

Proxy (Lets you provide a substitute or place holder for another object. A proxy controls access to the orginal object, allow you to perform something either before or after the request gets through the original object)
